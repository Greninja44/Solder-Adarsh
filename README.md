## ⚙️ How It Works
- Daylight: LDR keeps LEDs OFF.
- Darkness: LDR resistance rises, transistor turns ON, LEDs light up.
- Button: Press to light up manually anytime.

## 🛠️ Quick Assembly
1. Solder resistors and LDR
2. Mount LEDs and transistor (check polarity!)
3. Install push button (optional)
4. Attach coin cell holder
5. Insert battery and test!

## ⚡ Notes
- Adjust R5 (47kΩ) to tweak light sensitivity
- Double-check LED and transistor orientation!

# 🏁 Build it. Light it. Fly it! 🚀
