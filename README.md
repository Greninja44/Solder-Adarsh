# ✈️ Sukhoi Light-Sensitive LED Circuit

## 🚀 Overview
A stylish Sukhoi-shaped PCB that lights up LEDs in the dark using a GL5528 LDR and 2N3904 transistor, powered by a CR2032 battery.  
Fun to build, educational, and affordable!

## 🎯 Features
- Automatic LED activation in darkness
- Manual button control
- Low power & compact design
- Cool fighter jet PCB!

## 🛠️ Components and Cost (India)

| Component         | Qty | Price (INR) |
|-------------------|-----|-------------|
| CR2032 Battery     | 1   | ₹150         |
| Coin Cell Holder   | 1   | ₹25         |
| 2.2kΩ Resistors    | 4   | ₹10          |
| 47kΩ Resistor      | 1   | ₹10          |
| GL5528 LDR         | 1   | ₹25        |
| 2N3904 Transistor  | 1   | ₹30          |
| Push Button        | 1   | ₹25          |
| 5mm Red LEDs       | 2   | ₹15         |

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Daylight: LDR keeps LEDs OFF.
- Darkness: LDR resistance rises, transistor turns ON, LEDs light up.
- Button: Press to light up manually anytime.

## 🛠️ Quick Assembly
1. Solder resistors and LDR
2. Mount LEDs and transistor (check polarity!)
3. Install push button (optional)
4. Attach coin cell holder
5. Insert battery and test!

## ⚡ Notes
- Adjust R5 (47kΩ) to tweak light sensitivity
- Double-check LED and transistor orientation!

# 🏁 Build it. Light it. Fly it! 🚀
